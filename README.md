# Calculator-Java
Using Java and Apache NetBeans, I created a mathematical calculator which also has a dropdown help menu for remainder, sin, cosine, and tan buttons that take the user to the Wikipedia entries of those concepts.  

A PNG file is included along with the zip file which contains the source code along with build and project files needed to run the code.
